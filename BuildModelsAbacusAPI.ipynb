Used in business for 6 yrs as modified pick up truck by removing middle seat & folding 3rd row. Kids love this because they can lie down and sleep and watch tv. Our kids and parents in their 80s enjoyed trips to NY, VA, FL, LA, GA, TN, SC, NC, AL, TX, MA, CO. With this economy we are glad to have Toyotas in our family. Camry 02 replaced 88 Celica.

I use regular octane -- also Plus and Premium at times. I also have found the cloth/velour seats to be very practical -- warm on cold days, cool on hot ones. Transmission-wise, it just knows when to shift for you -- it's really a symbiotic relationship between car and driver, to use that analogy. The driver's seat needs more back support, though.

It performed amazingly andI am now smitten with this machine.I really enjoy driving it and on a smooth road, it is terrific.I am averaging nearly 30 mpg . My driving is all at 60mph where I live . No regrets on this purchase.Update 2016 : I love this car. I looked at the new models that came out this year and I think the 2013 looks better.Update 2018: This car still  impresses me.
